<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

Most features are self-explanatory, briefly described below:
## Intentions
- Add new intentions (remember to add the goal number (e.g. `1)`) otherwise it will be entered as `&`)
- List intentions for the day
- Complete intentions

## Pomodoros üçÖ
- Start a pomodoro (default length set in Settings) 

### üçÖ While running

- Check remaining üçÖ time
- Cancel üçÖ

## Timers ‚è≥
- Start a timer (default length set in Settings) 
- Start a 'targeted' timer to the top of the hour (:00) or next half-hour (:30)

### ‚è≥ While running

- Check remaining ‚è≥ time 
- Pause and restart ‚è≥
- Cancel ‚è≥



<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & Known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>


- Pausing a targeted time will shift the end time accordingly (for example, if you pause for 10 min and then restart a timer that is supposed to end at 9:30, it will end at 9:40). Unsure how to deal with this special case: 1) not allow pausing for targeted timers or 2) calculate the new timer duration after pausing. I will add this feature in future releases based on interest and feedback. 
- nothing else for now, but please let me know if you see anything!
